# Solutions to Project Euler

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/jkilver/ProjectEuler.svg?branch=master)](https://api.travis-ci.org/jkilver/ProjectEuler)

This repo contains my solutions to the problems for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). I intend to write my solutions in python and C++. 

I also want to use this repo to practice continuous integration, so I want to add Docker and Travis builds and automated tests.
